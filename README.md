# rtherm

In this project I aim to implement a remote switch to our home
thermostat in order to get acquainted with ARM programming, android
app development, internet of things, electronics, and last but not
least to have a nice and warm living when I get home in winter. 

### Materials
* honeywell chronotherm IV modulation
* particle photon
* some small stuff
 * 2 1.5V AA batteries
 * xx Ohm resistor
 * transistor P2N2222A
 * some wire

### Configure the photon
```
$ particle create webhook photon/webhooks/thermostat.json
```
